# UNIX Signals Data Exchange Program - 42cursus-Minitalk

This repository contains a program built with C, Makefile, UNIX signals, and Shell that enables small data exchange using UNIX signals. 
The program leverages these technologies to establish signal-based communication between processes, allowing for efficient data transfer 
and synchronization.

Technologies Used

C
C is a powerful programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control. It provides direct access to memory and 
system resources, making it suitable for systems programming. In this project, C is used to implement the data exchange program 
and handle UNIX signals.

Makefile
Makefile is a build automation tool used to compile and build software projects. It allows defining dependencies, compiling rules, 
and automating the build process. In this project, Makefile is used to compile the C program and generate the executable.

UNIX Signals
UNIX signals are software interrupts used by processes in UNIX-like operating systems to communicate with each other. They provide a 
way to notify a process about various events or to request specific actions. In this project, UNIX signals are utilized to establish 
communication channels between processes for data exchange.

Shell
Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks using command-line interpreters. It provides a scripting language to execute commands, 
manipulate files, and perform various system operations. In this project, Shell scripting is used to run and control the execution of 
the data exchange program.
